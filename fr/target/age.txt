0	Hypermite
1	Hypermite \r \r ^804000 The so-called "Hypermite" is the myth of creation that gave rise to many mythologies around the world. In recent years, part of its content was known to the public thanks to the Grand Foundation. \r \rThe history that precedes the Big Bang, about 30 billion years ago, is unknown. According to the researchers, before the Big Bang, the universe had no form. This project of the universe was known as Chaos. However, there is another version of the story that counts: there was a universe before the Big Bang, but all its record has been erased. According to the story, the last ruler of that world was Cronus, the God of Time. For some reason, at the end of his reign, he destroyed all the time from the beginning, resulting in the Big Bang. \r \rThe great explosion destroyed everything, but it restarted the time of the universe to its origin and created the most Sacrée of all the powers: The "Divine Will". There are also rumors that the explosion destroyed Cronos himself, but that his will will be reborn in the future. Still, they say that, when reborn, maybe Cronos is not the same one of those times ...
2	Birth of Life
3	Birth of life \r \r ^804000 After the explosion, the Divine Will collided with fragments of the universe, forming the stars that shine in the sky, space and planets. The Divine Will was disseminated by the universe creating life. The first lives were: Mother Earth (Gaia), Heaven (Uranus) and the Sea (Points). They did not have human characteristics, but they had a purely spiritual body and later they were called "Gods of Creation". \r \rAfter the creation of the three Gods, the Divine Will created more lives: the abyss (Tartaros), the darkness (Erebos), the night (Nyx) and love (Eros). Even if life already existed, the earth was still only darkness. Later, he created the first light in the universe, which shone on Gaia's arm, causing a permanent scar. The light of that scar was condensed and transformed into a golden material, capable of producing lethal wounds in the Gods. Gaia called her Luz de Nacimiento.
4	Birth of the Titans
5	Birth of the Titans \r \r ^804000 After the emergence of love (Eros), the Gods of Creation began to reproduce, giving birth to divinities with physical bodies. First Gaia and Uranus related and gave birth to twelve superior gods, they are the second generation of creation: the Titans. They represent the bright side of the Divine Will. \r \r The six Titans were: Ocean (Water), Ceos (Intelligence), Hyperion (Sun), Crio (Growth), Lapetus (Soul) and Cronus (Time). The six Titanics were Teia (Treasure, Light and Vision), Rhea (Time), Themis (Law), Mnemosyne (Memory), Phoebe (Moon) and Thetis (Sea).
6	N. of the Dark.
7	Birth of Darkness \r \r ^804000 Night (Nyx) and darkness (Erebos) related and gave birth to the twin gods of Death (Thanatos) and Dream (Hypnos), as well as many other gods of the family of darkness. They represent the dark side of the Divine Will. \r \rAmong the gods of the family of darkness are the Moiras (Destiny), Cacia (Mal), Apate (Lies and Deception), Keres (Fatality), Nemesis (Indignation) , Geras (Old Age), Eurynomos (Podrecimiento), Momo (Defamation), Oizus (Sadness), Moors (Violent Death and Disgrace), Macas (Battle), Amphilogiai (Talk), Limos (Hunger), Lete (Forgetfulness), Disnomia (Rape), Pseudologos (Lies), Androktasiai (Massacre), Fonos (Murder), Neikea (Disputes), Tie (Destruction), Algea (Disaster) and Ponos (Hard Work).
8	Era of the Titans
9	Era of the Titans \r \r ^804000 Chronos faced his father, Uranus, to take control of creation with the clan of the Titans. When defeating it, it became the second generation of Kings of the Gods, initiating the Era of the Titans. \r \r As a king, Cronos did nothing for the spirits imprisoned in the Tartaros, which led Gaia to try to recreate them and, as a consequence, the Giants emerged. Their immense bodies demanded many natural resources to be preserved, which caused a devastating hunger in their lands, later leading them to extinction. Many monuments created to the Giants are still found today, such as the tombs of the Euphrates Valley, in Turkey, and the Stonehenge, in England. \r \rThe fall of the Giants allowed a new way of life of character to be born evil one. Irrational beasts that destroyed each other, few lasted longer than their first period. Some of the most famous monsters in mythology, such as the Kraken, Cetus and the Serpents of Ares are members of this family of creatures, the beasts of antiquity.
10	Matador of Gods
11	Matador of Gods \r \r ^804000Gaia could not stand the tyranny of her husband, Uranus, and began to plan her defeat. Of all her children, only the youngest, Cronos, agreed to help her. Gaia sends the Light of Birth to the abyss of the Tartaros, where the Cyclops can use it to turn it into a weapon to kill gods, without the Titan son noticing. \r \rThe legend says that, in addition to the weapon, a part of the Birth Light was used by the Goddess of Night, Nyx, to build a defense tool as well. That equipment would be known in the future as the Egide.
12	Desp. Human.
13	Awakening of Humans \r \rFor the Divine Will, the molds of life and existence were transformed into the form we know today, which means that the new gods will be born in this generation of human beings. \r \rWith the evolution of humanity, some people could touch the Divine Will, causing them to grow to a transcendental form. Three of them were Zeus, Hades and Poseidon, who would be worshiped as gods. The Divine Will, which would be known as the "Ninth Sense", is the highest existential level that connects a person to the universe in full magnitude. \r \rThe inferior humans would only achieve the "Eighth Sense", which gives them freedom under the influence of the gods and power to move freely between the territory of the living and the dead. The first five senses are those of the body, the sixth is intuition and the seventh is the control of the Cosmo itself. \r \rZeus led the gods of that era to Mount Olympus, where humanity would rule. Those who went against the divinities would go to Mount Otris, preparing for the final attack.
14	Titanomachy
15	Titanomachy \r \r ^804000 The titans wished to have control of the universe and, to conquer it, opposed the gods that accompanied Zeus, initiating a 10-year war that would be remembered as "Titanomaquia". \r \rWhile the onslaught occurred, Zeus frees the Hecatonquiros and Cyclopes from enemy control, the Hecatonchires launch a fulminating attack against the Titans, and the Cyclops enter into an agreement to build weapons for the three main gods: a ray spear for Zeus, a trident for Poseidon and a sword for Hades. \r \rAt the end of the battle, after a 1,000-day confrontation between Zeus and Cronos, the intervention of the goddess Metis caused Cronos to lose his shield, and was finally defeated by the Olympian leader.
16	Olympus
17	Origin of Olympus \r \r ^804000 After the defeat of the Titans, the Gods of Olympus left their prisoners in the abyss of Tartarus, and sent the Hecatonchires to watch the penance. In addition, according to the goddess Metis's warning, Zeus, Poseidon and Hades sealed Cronos, who manages the time, so he could not use his power again. \r \rThe descendants of the tribe of the Titans who participated in the Titanomachy were imprisoned in the abyss of Tartarus. Among them, Atlas was penalized by Zeus, who forced him to lift the sky on his back for eternity. \r \rAfter the victory in the war, the population of the Olympian gods grew rapidly. Zeus won his twin sons (Apollo and Artemis) by the goddess Leto. Later, he generated the fire god, Hephaestus, the god of war, Ares, and the goddess of discord, Eris, through the goddess Hera. He also gave life to the goddess of beauty, Aphrodite, through the goddess Dione.
18	Birth of Athena
19	Birth of Athena \r \r ^804000After Titanomachy, Zeus marries Metis and lives in a time of prosperity - that is, until Gaia prophesies that a child will inherit the power and intelligence of Zeus and usurp his throne. Afraid of losing his power, Zeus swallows Metis to prevent his children, still inside the goddess, from being born. \r \r But Metis used his own blood to create an armor for his daughter, and used the Light of Birth ( inherited from Gaia) to equip it. That Light would become the Scepter of Nike, "the killing weapon of the gods". \r \rZeus, with a very serious headache - without knowing that it was because Metis had given birth inside him - asks Hephaestus to open his skull with his ax. In doing so, a new deity was born, wearing an armor made of blood and a staff capable of wounding divinities. It was the birth of Athena.
20	F. from Olympus
21	Olympus Formation \r \rAfter settling into Olympus, Zeus began distributing the territories among his gods. Being the king, he took control of earth and sky, and abdicated the seas for Poseidon and the Royaume des Enfers for Hades. The rest of the gods of the Olympic pantheon included Hera (Queen of the Gods), Athena (Wisdom and War), Apollo (Sun), Artemis (Moon and Hunting), Aphrodite (Beauty), Hephaestus (Fire), Hermes (Messenger of the Gods) and Dionísio (Alcoholic Beverages). \r \rDespite this, Nyx continued to develop a great role in the ancient era, but people assumed that all he did was to inhabit the Tartarus. Their gods of darkness were the only ones capable of facing the gods of Olympus, but they were losing their intensity with the absence of the Titans, and some end up yielding to the new gods - like Thanatos and Hypnos, who swore allegiance to Hades.
22	Last Titan
23	The Last Titan \r \r ^804000With the fall of the Titans and the gods of darkness, Gaia gave birth to the last Titan, Typhon, "the son of Tartarus". The creature is born on the exact border between the world of the living and the dead, and had the power over fire and wind. In addition, he later wins children known in mythology, such as Can Cerberus, Sphinx and the Dragon des Mers, acquiring fame as the Father of Monsters. \r \rGaia offers to the Cyclopes what remained of the Light of Birth to make the Hammer of the Tempest, so that Typhon could use it in combat, and they left the two against Mount Olympus. The fury of the Titan makes almost all the gods become animals to flee, except Athena, who stays to fight. Motivated by the courage of his daughter, Zeus returns and, together with the other gods, they manage to defeat Typhoon in a long and violent battle.
24	Pandora
25	Pandora \r \r ^804000 After the fall of Typhon, a new Titan emerges, very different from the usual ones. Prometheus is revered by humans, and promises to help them whenever possible. Thus, he steals the fire of the gods and gives it to humanity, teaching them to use it in their favor. Zeus, possessed by the daring of Prometheus, sent a woman named Pandora to the town of Titan loaded with a mysterious box sealed. \r \r After marrying the brother of Prometheus, Pandora opens the box and, to his surprise, frees all The gods give the darkness sealed by the King of Olympus. Gods of Hunger, Lie, Chance, Death ... His release caused catastrophic damage to the population, causing that Pandora was hated by his damn box, but did not know the contents. The revolts were so great that, in an attempt to exterminate her, they killed her brother, causing her to rebel completely before mortals and gods. \r \rIn that moment, Hades manifests himself, and tells him that he will free his brother if she will accept to serve and obey the God des Enfers for the rest of eternity. She accepts, and thus they seal a pact that lasts until the present days.
26	Flood
27	The Great Flood \r \rAs a way to cleanse the world of people they considered impure, Zeus and Poseidon came together to cause a deluge that lasted 40 days. The waves and the current took the lives of many, and only a few humans managed to survive under the protection of Athena. Those humans found a new continent and called it "Mu" ("mother" in the ancient language). Guided by the Goddess of Wisdom, the survivors were consolidated in their new territory, developing their astrology, astronomy and alchemy. \r \rConcluyendo its mission to cleanse the Earth, Zeus went on to question major reasons about its existence, as the origins of Gaia, the state of Cronos and what existed before the Big Bang. With these questions in mind, Zeus decided to cede to Athena the position of ruler of the Earth and goes to Mount Olympus, where he would evaluate how he would continue from there, planning strategies that one day humanity would have to prepare to face.
28	Am. Of Poseidon
29	Ambition of Poseidon \r \r ^804000With the absence of Zeus, Poseidon felt that he could take advantage of Athena for being a lesser goddess and take control of his territory. The God of the Seas found a rare substance at the bottom of the ocean, called "Oricalco". Using that mineral, he built armor inspired by sea monsters and called them "Scales". \r \rTo organize his troops, Poseidon built a marine fortress in the territory that was known as Atlantis. There, he gathered his most powerful followers and gave them his own Scales. The seven elected received the nickname of Generals Marina and each one would be the regent of one of the seven seas.
30	1st G. Santa
31	The First Holy War \r \rAthena was warned by Poseidón that, if he did not give up his territory, he would advance with his troops. The Goddess of Wisdom, which was against the use of weapons in battle, taught her followers to fight only with their fists, but the disadvantage was clear against the Scales of the Marine Generals of the God of the Seas. \r \rTo balance The attack, Athena worked with the inhabitants of Mu to build armor for their warriors. In total there were 88 armor, 12 Or, 24 Argent, 48 Bronze and 4 unclassified. This is how the Knights of Athena were born. \r \rThe presence of his Knights made the course of the attack completely altered. In that way, the Navy Generals were defeated and the entire territory of Atlantis sank in the seas. Athena, in turn, sealed the soul of Poseidon in an amphora and kept it at the North Pole. After 1,000 years, the God of the Seas woke up, but did not try to confront his rival for their territories.
32	Armors
33	The Sacrée Armor \r \r ^804000 Unlike the Scales of Poseidon, which were produced based only on the Oricalco, the Athena Armor had a more complex composition. In addition to the rare metal, there is also Gamanio and Stardust, making its structure much more elaborate than that of the rivals General Marina. \r \rEl Gamanio is what gives more resistance to the armor. For this reason, the concentration of this mineral in the Golden Armors is higher than in the Argent ones, and in the Argent ones greater than in the Bronze ones. Already the Star Dust is another mineral that contains, in its essence, a fragment of Divine Will. Therefore, all armor are living beings with their own soul, capable of resonating with the Cosmo of their knight. \r \rIn addition, the armor needs blood from someone with the strong Cosmo to adjust, thus rehabilitating their properties. The stronger the Cosmo of the one offering the blood, the greater the evolution of the armor. With the blood of a God, the armor can reach levels never seen ...
34	2nd G. Santa
35	^ff0affThe Second Holy War \r \r ^804000 Shortly after the conclusion of the attack between Athena and Poseidon, the God des Enfers, Hades, invoked the so-called "Well of Hell" that connected the physical world with its own world. By this passage, a Guild of warriors from the kingdom of the dead dominated the terrain and attacked Athena and her followers. The battle was intense and Hades had access to the Soldats who fell in the previous battles. \r \rWhen Hades attacked Athena directly, the first Pegase Knight, Rodorio, interposed to protect her. Although he was hit by the sword of Hades, the warrior managed to wound his adversary, being the first time a human wounded a divinity. Because of that, Rodorio was remembered as "The Pegase of Sacrifice", and it is said that until today his soul accompanies the Pegase Knights in their purpose of defending Athena. \r \rHerido, Hades was forced to retreat to the Champs Elysees, where he decided to keep his own body, fearing the destruction of his human form - by conquering the plan of the living, he could only walk through that territory with his true body. Hades began to select the human with the purest soul of each generation to incarnate in his body. In this Holy War, Pandora's brother was chosen, but with the army des Enfers weakened, Athena was able to overcome it and seal his soul.
36	Royaume des Enfers Organization
37	Organization des Enfers \r \r ^804000 In a later Holy War, the young man chosen to be the guest of Hades did not succumb to the influence of the deity, and committed suicide to prevent the advent of the God des Enfers. To prevent that from happening, God began to reincarnate his most faithful servant, Pandora, as long as such a pure soul was born on Earth, in order to protect her body and prepare it for when the onslaught came. \r \rWhile that, in In the infernal territory, Hades organized his troops with a powerful Guild of 108 warriors, called "Specters". That army des Enfers was commanded by three generals who had a strength beyond the ordinary. These were Rhadamanthe of Wyvern, Minos of Grifo and Éaque of Garuda, the trinity that was known as "The Three Judges of Hell". Thanks to these valuable warriors, in each Holy War the chosen ones to dress the Sapuris of Wyvern, Grifo and Garuda would be renamed with their names.
38	The Sanctuaire
39	The Sanctuaire \r \r ^804000 A pattern was detected for the return of Hades through a receptacle. Approximately every 250 years, someone with a pure soul was born capable of hosting the God des Enfers and allowing him to advance again against the plan of the living. To confront him, Athena went on to reincarnate in that same periodicity, in order to lead his knights against the troops des Enfers. \r \rTo save the armor of the constellations, train new knights and serve as a base of operation, Athena built the Sanctuaire, in Greece. To prepare the ground for his next incarnations, he transformed his own armor into a statue and kept it at the top of the Sanctuaire and, to rule the place in his absence, chose the knight with greater wisdom, patience and courage to be the Grand Pope, literally a Pope, the "representative of Athena on Earth". \r \rIn the vicinity of the Sanctuaire, a village was built for those who not only praised the Goddess, but also set out to help in the maintenance of the Sacrée territory. The small town was named Village Rodorio, in homage to the first Pegase Knight
40	The Phoenix Armor
41	The Phoenix Armor \r \r ^804000The wound that Rodorio caused Hades was bleeding. The alchemists of Mu responsible for the construction of armor tried to use the blood of the deity to make a special outfit. This is how the Phoenix Armor was created, capable of regenerating itself even if it turns into ashes. Due to his incredible power, although it was a Bronze Armor, he was considered indomitable, not being able to find a Knight able to dress her. \r \rMu many alchemists tried to reproduce the effect of the Phoenix Armor on other armors, but they failed. They tried to use another structure and other minerals, thus building the Black Armor, which were replicas of the original garments of the constellations that defended Athena. However, they had no soul like the originals, therefore, they were not able to have synergy with a Knight. At last they were rejected and kept in a territory that would one day be called Isla de la Reina Muerte.
42	Gigantomaquia
43	Gigantomaquia \r \r ^804000 Many ages after the battle against Zeus and Olympus, Typhon returns with his Giants, declaring war on humanity. The battle was extremely violent, carrying the onslaught to the heart of the continent of Mu, where there were many casualties for the faction of Athena. \r \rThe battle reaches its apex when Porfirion murders the Emperor of Mu, leaving the Goddess of Wisdom furious . It is one of the only times in history that we see Athena fighting at full power, eliminating Porfirio and, later, after a 1,000-day battle, defeating and sealing Typhoon under Etna volcano.
44	Remains of Mu
45	The Fall of Mu \r \r ^804000 After an earthquake for no apparent reason, colossal waves snatched the continent of Mu, sinking into the depths of the ocean. A small fragment of the territory, the place where the Black Armor was forged, survived the impact, becoming the Island of the Death Queen. With the exception of this island and four survivors within the alchemists, Mu disappeared completely from the map. \r \rIt is not known what drove Mu to sink, but it is believed that it could have been a revenge planned by Gaia, after the inhabitants of There they defeated their son, Typhoon. \r \rAfter so much migration, the surviving alchemists found in the Himalayas similar properties to their old territory, as the presence of the Star Dust for the construction of armors. They started living in that area, and they called it "Jamir" (which means "eternal existence" in the native language of Mu). The descendants of that tribe would be the only ones with the knowledge to build and repair armor.
46	The Ad. of Ares
47	The Advent of Ares \r \rIn 900 BC, seeking revenge for a defeat in Troy, the God of War Ares provokes a new Holy War against the Knights of Athena. The troops of the ferocious divinity were divided into four squads: "Flame", "Fire", "Terror" and "Calamity", while the warriors who served it were called Berserkers, due to their fury on the battlefield. No less, the advantage was clear and it seemed that this attack was lost to the forces of the Sanctuaire. \r \rWhat made the tide turn against the Berserkers was a mutual decision of the Knight of Balance of the time and Athena. When the two approved, the twelve Balance weapons could be used by the Soldats of Athena, and this was the case. After their use was released, the warriors of Ares began to be massacred, forcing the God of War to retreat. \r \rThe result of the confrontation was so violent that Athena reiterated her disapproval of the use of weapons on the battlefield, placing as law that those tools should only be used again in the last case, in a mutual decision of the Goddess herself and the Balance Knight of the generation.
48	At. Prohibited
49	The Forbidden Attack \r \r ^804000 A decade later, Ares forces discovered the existence of a legendary relic, hidden in the environs of Mount Fuji, which could give them an advantage against Athena. Thus, they will organize and advance to conquer such a tool and take revenge for the previous defeat. \r \rWithout Balance's weapons this time, the Golden Knights were having difficulty containing the Berserkers. The Knights of Verseau, Gemeaux and Capricorne, then, united their Cosmo in a single point and shot it at once, a blast so intense that they claimed to rival the power of the Big Bang. The stories called that attack "Exclamation of Athena." The impact of the blow was so great that it deformed the scenario, creating what we know today as Lake Motosu, which will never freeze due to the Cosmo of the golden warriors that still inhabit the place. \r \r When Athena knew what happened, she made it clear that she disapproves of the use of the technique in an unequal combat (as, for example, three against one), and that if that happened, those responsible should be ashamed and abdicate their Knight of Athena title. The three Golden Knights, to redeem themselves, moved away from the Sanctuaire and built the Shinto Village, where they trained young aspiring knights.
50	Cab. Blacks
51	The Black Knights \r \r ^804000 Eventually, the island that once was a fragment of the continent of Mu was discovered. Isolated in the ocean, it served as a prison for a cruel despot, a tyrant queen who confronted the Knights of Athena. She died alone on the island, and from there came the nickname of the place of Isla de la Reina Muerte. \r \rAfterwards, still used as a kind of prison, several dark, soulless armor were discovered. The renegade warriors of the Goddess of Wisdom and their constellations found in these armor a way to gain power. The rebels proclaimed themselves Black Knights, which went against the teachings of the Goddess. \r \rOne of the prisoners on the island, a powerful warrior with the intention of redeeming himself, proposed for Athena to serve as a seal to keep the insurgents there. Thus, the Goddess created a mask that would serve as a key, setting them on the island, and entrusted it to the warrior, who was renamed Guilty. From generation to generation, the name and mask are passed to another guardian of the island who wants to find redemption.
52	G.S. Previous
53	The Holy War Previous \r \r ^804000In 1743, a new Holy War between Hades and Athena hatched, the most recent before the current times. During the attack, the Vierge Knight used his very high Cosmo and the full control of the Eighth Sense to invade the Royaume des Enfers and collect 108 fruits of the Sapindus of Hell, a mystical tree used as raw material in the making of the Sapuris of the Specters. With these fruits, the golden warrior created, at the cost of his own life, the Rosary of 108 Accounts, a relic capable of sealing the souls of the defeated enemies, preventing Hades from bringing them back indefinitely. \r \rThe act of the Vierge Knight turned the game for Athena, who quickly gained space and managed to defeat the rival des Enfers. After the confrontation, only two knights survived: Shion de Áries and Dohko de Balance. Shion, descendant of Mu, became the Master of the Sanctuaire and was responsible for recreating Athena's army until the next Holy War began. Already Dohko was responsible for monitoring the seal of the 108 Specters in Rozán. To live long enough until the next battle between divinities, Athena graced it with the Misopethamenos technique, which reduced the aging of the body in a ratio of one year to one day.
54	Our Era
55	Our Era \r \r ^804000 Thirteen years ago, they say that the Knight of Sagittaire, Aioros, who would be chosen to be the next Master of the Sanctuaire, tried to kill the child who was the incarnation of Athena. He fled with the baby and, as punishment, was attacked by Capricorne Shura. After falling from a cliff, his whereabouts remained unknown, as well as that of the Armor of Sagittaire, the Scepter of Athena and the reincarnated Goddess herself. \r \rWhile that in Germany, the territory of the Heinstein family was isolated from all the rest of the world, becoming a castle covered by darkness. They came to say that animals died only when approaching the castle. It is not known exactly what made that happen, but it is a sharp sour of the worst kind. \r \rThe Knight of Belier, Mu, suddenly left the Sanctuaire and went on to live only in Jamir. They say that he knew of some possible conspiracy, but nobody dares to investigate it. What Mu is plotting or trying to discover, it is up to the new knights that emerge here to try to unveil ...

" This passage was taken from the Work Diary of the signalman, Lahm. A large number of animals around the Sanctuaire suffered some mutation, even some inhabitants were infected by the bloodthirsty atmosphere and became moribund. All the signs pointed to the God of Nothing, Lamech. Maybe the "Shades of another world" event is the beginning of a nightmare.

But the good news is that the person responsible for the signals, Lahm, used the Mythological Crystal and managed to prevent the spread of the bloodthirsty virus. Even if the virus is not completely cured, collecting a large amount of Mythological Crystal, knocked down during the Holy War, seems to be the best option at this time.
