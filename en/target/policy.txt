40	You worry too much!
41	I'll give you one more chance! Go back to your place!
42	Thank you, Knights of the Goddess! Now I return to the dream Yggdrasil ...
43	Peace and justice of the earth. They are in your hands!
44	By having this ring, you will have the power to rule the world!
45	What will you choose?
46	Come conquer and dominate the world!
47	With this ring, the world is yours!
48	Do what you want! Do not doubt it! Hahahahaha !!!
49	Thanks, I'm so much better!
50	Leave it to me!
51	If you want to be brave like me, then you will have an answer from me.
52	During all these years, I have had the life of the brothers of a traitor.
53	But that did not make me give up. Instead, I have even more urgency to discover the truth!
54	I hope you can remember not to give in the face of adversity, do not be afraid!
55	I am the symbol of justice in your heart, Knight!
56	Do not be fooled by appearances, keep your beliefs!
57	Justice does not disappear because of the oppression of evil!
58	As long as there is light on this earth, justice will be in the human heart!
59	Gloria, my young man, do you want glory?
60	What is glory? Is it to survive the holy war? Is it not to fear the fight against the gods?
61	Or, as the most qualified Knight, in charge of observing the return of the Underworld?
62	None of that is, my young man, the glory is in your heart! It's just fighting for faith, fighting for justice! That is the glory!
63	Help! Help!
64	I understand, sir. I'm going to leave now.
65	Let them see our power!
66	By Yggdrasil!
67	Yggdrasil will not be occupied by the navies!
68	Come! Look who is really brave!
69	We have to get there, we can not be defeated here!
70	Alexer has been waiting for you for a long time, princess!
71	... They are the warriors of my sister Valkyries, who undoubtedly convinced me.
72	Sorry, I have to go, this is the only way to stop my brother.
73	All of you are from the clan of blue warriors, the clan is proud of you
74	If the fate of the blue clan is in my hands, then I hope to give a better destiny ...
75	Princess Natassia! Think!
76	Princess! Now your actions are linked to the security of the world! Believe in us, let's protect it!
77	Princess! Please, enough! Even over only one of the blue warrior clan, we will protect her to death!
78	I want to be close to Julian again!
79	Letting my prisoner go so imprudently?
80	Damn! He really was captured!
81	Thanks!
82	Thanks, I still have to fight!
83	Blue Ice Warriors will never be defeated
84	Thank you, Knights of the Goddess! Now I return to the dream Yggdrasil ...
85	Except, thank you!
86	Odious Witch! Die!
87	Damn! Dammit!
88	Pirates! I heard they want to take over our food and water. What should we do?
89	Come with me.
90	Gra ...... Thanks ... I can go home!
91	Stay by my side, or else ... Hunf!
92	And the people? Where are they?
93	That's bad! Come back to search!
94	I do not know, old things go very fast.
95	Come and find me!
96	Come for me!
97	Quick, come and get me!
98	Ang ah ang ......
99	You're damn, do not move!
100	Hunf, if you want to save Athena or send Golden Knights, come!
101	This is what you sent yourself!
102	My patience has run out!
103	Phoenix Bird!
104	Damn! They discovered us!
105	Well, here I can come back with psychokinesis!
106	Oh, you found me!
107	It does not count! This time, it does not count!
108	Hey, what's that smell? That is terrible. It is the perfume of the spirit of the sea!
109	What do you want to do?
110	Do not even think you'll go through me!
111	Hunf, this time I'm going to let you go!
112	They came very fast!
113	Hunf, this time I'm going to let you go!
114	Trust in you? Where did your Twelve Golden Knights go?
115	Old friend, we meet again!
116	You are very funny, Stay here in the Underworld forever!
117	Crueeeeel
118	The snakes of the Underworld seem to have changed a lot, that's bad! Luisa she ......
119	Destroy the plans of Lord Hades? They are delirious!
120	People have to pay the price for their innocence!
121	How is it possible ...?
122	He really was able to see through our disguises!
123	I came back again, to destroy the Sanctuary ......
124	Hey, if you want to go down that road, you first have to go through me.
125	Kill him, Pandora, and you will undoubtedly have great rewards! Hey ......
126	Although the Hidden Dragon Village is hidden, before on the way to the Village there was always one or two villagers, but now why is there no one?
127	Let's go a little faster, I have a bad feeling.
128	We arrived, here is the Hidden Dragon Village.
129	From now on I want to pray with devotion to the dragon god.
130	God, please grant Shiryu the vision again!
131	God, please grant Shiryu the vision again!
132	Come on, I want to show my strength to those people!
133	Me, I'm going to call someone! Shiryu is on the terrace of the cabin. See you!
134	This is bad ...... so fast ...... many villagers went crazy ......
135	Master! Take a look again, fast!
136	Come on quickly, I know that here at the waterfall there is a road to return to the village.
137	Do not know how is Shiryu? Did you return to the village?
138	On this road normally there is nobody, I did not imagine that it would be discovered by those monsters too!
139	We can take him to find Li-yun, I think he'll find a way to free the villagers from the poison!
140	Ah ......
141	Oh, how it hurts!
142	Let's go fast!
143	It is necessary to leave the village quickly, we have to be careful ......
144	Snakes here seem restless, we have to be careful.
145	We must restore peace and tranquility in Rozan!
146	We arrived!
147	I was sleeping? I should go back home!
148	How did this happen? In the end ... what ... did I do?
149	Cof, cof ...... Uff ......
150	Hey ... it's Shunrei!
151	Hey, what's wrong with me? I was sleeping? I have to go back to my house.
152	Why? Why does Shiryu still have to fight? Shiryu ... do not try so hard ...
153	Shiryu ... Your eyes ...
154	Master! Oh ...
155	Everything is fine, the bleeding and I stop, I still have to continue fighting!
156	After hundreds of years there is finally someone who dares to start the Dragon trial!
157	Knight, no matter what your purpose is, whoever wants to see the dragon has to go through the Dragon's test.
158	Oh, about what you say I do not know, pick up some flowers to scare the lord!
159	Hey, why is my head spinning? In the end what flowers are these? How has it become two people?
160	Hunf ...... Hunf ...... Hunf, Hunf ......
161	Hunf, Hunf ...... Hunf ...... Hunf ......
162	Mask of Death, Do you want to know if the villagers are poisoned? Did you forget? They became like this because of your Sekishiki effect!
163	Although it was not on purpose, those fools drank the water mixed with your Sekishiki ...... he he he, they have something to do with that traitor of the Sanctuary, Shiryu, we can use ......
164	Hey ...... What place is this? So beautiful ...... I'm so sleepy
165	Ignorant insects, try the strength of true Sekishiki!
166	Come with me.
167	Go find me!
168	Come with me, there in front is the dragon's crest.
169	Thank you! If it were not for you, I would never see my wife again!
170	Do not think you'll know something through my mouth. I'm sure that man will come to save me.
171	Li-Yun let me help you. Is this the spy you captured?
172	Do not say nonsense! Talk or it will not help you.
173	Sss!
174	See the hit!
175	A mere Bronze Knight does not deserve that I use all my strength!
176	A common hit is enough to deal with you!
177	Quick, take a look! Many apprentices were injured by Cassios!
178	I'm going to look for Marin ......
179	Hahaha, the so-called justice is just words, Knight, it's all you say ......
180	Marin, we already found Aiya. But ...... but ...... when we found her a strange power attacked, all the apprentices fainted!
181	The battle began. See if the enemy is?
182	Transformation, Transformation!
183	It did not transform
184	After a long period of practice, their strength has greatly increased.
185	I hope that one day I can also go to the Colosseum and participate in the battle for the armor!
186	Armor is the legacy of the mythological era - it's just using it and you can unleash the strongest power in the world ......
187	Look, all your kicks and kicks are focused on success. He has already mastered the right way to fight the Knights!
188	Every day there are people in the Colosseum who fight for the armor, but those who are really capable of obtaining one are few.
189	Hey, have you heard? In recent times due to the friction between the agents of Marin and Shina, several conflicts have occurred.
190	Hey, let's go from here. In this training, I am afraid that if we had not become Knights, we would already be dead.
191	Shut up! In this case you should not talk about that in front of me, I will not leave the Sanctuary without a suit of armor.
192	After so much time, I woke up ... You, in front of me Are you a Knight?
193	I feel in you a strong sense of justice and great energy in your Cosmo. From now on, you have to take responsibility to protect the Goddess and the earth!
194	That the Sanctuary seeks justice is a joke, what happened thirteen years ago is proof of this!
195	Only the King of the Underworld is qualified to rule the earth.
196	Hunf! It seems that you are a difficult person, I have important plans to do, we will meet again!
197	Hahaha! Idiot knights, they did not really notice my disguise!
198	It can not be said that there is justice in the Sanctuary, there is the power to dominate the world!
199	Even if you have the Prometheus hammer, you are not yet a rival to the God of sleep, if you have capacity, come and attack it!
200	Thanks for sending me back.
201	Why did such a fearsome soldier appear? I think it's not a bit safe here.
202	I do not know what happened ... but when I woke up, you showed up.
203	Ah! In front is the Village Roderio, great!
204	Here is a forbidden zone !!! Get out fast!
205	Protect the Sanctuary!
206	Fidelity to the Goddess!
207	The Underworld troops emerged here!
208	Advance!
209	Mate! Mate! Mate!
210	For the Shrine! For the Goddess!
211	The armor of Sagittarius is a relic, it can not be blasphemed by foreigners!
212	Thanks, I feel better, now I can fight again!
213	I will overtake! Goodbye Goodbye ~
214	Who is so daring? Watch me break your teeth!
215	Someone really invaded the temple of the God of the dream!
216	Come with me!
217	Hey, is not that slave who hid in the darkness of the cave?
218	Hunf, Knights? If you do not fear death, come.
219	Then the Knights are that strong! I ... I want to be a Knight!
220	Is the Lord really willing to forgive me? I ...... I will regret my sins!
221	Thanks for saving me!
222	Knight of the cursed darkness, I'll show you my power.
223	Did Acer send you here?
224	I do not need your help, I go out alone!
225	Thanks for your help!
226	Thanks for your help.
227	Thanks for your help!
228	This is the residence of the slaves. Look! They rescued them after those rocks!
229	What did you say? They are all dead! Hahaha, better dead!
230	Are you the person who will deliver the message? Talk about the details!
231	Come with me!
232	For the protection of the master of the slaves, every day the key words change.
233	We arrived. You wait for me here.
234	Lord, chicken bone soup and turtle!
235	Those Knights in their ambush, they're all dead!
236	Only by saying the correct keyword can you see the slave master.
237	You brought a smart point. Maybe if the Knight stays happy he will give you some reward!
238	Unless you defeat me, you will not get more information from me!
239	The best thing is that you leave here, that's not your business!
240	Oh, it seems you still have a little trick, but unfortunately I am your opponent!
241	Hunf, here it will become your hell!
242	Unfortunately, you can not change your death as a result of the struggle!
243	Hey, I seem to be listening to the sound of a trumpet. Could it be that the ship arrived?
244	Who are you? Damn! You're a Knight!
245	I do not want to remember what happened that day
246	In the village there are still some spies deeply hidden.
247	Before telling you what happened thirteen years ago, I have to find a safe place.
248	Oh, I've found a place, come with me.
249	The priest is inside the church!
250	Oh, you really are stubborn! Really a headache!
251	How they are going to accept you to come here! Finish everything!
252	I'm just a blacksmith, how could I be the servant of an earl? How silly ......
253	That bastard says I'm a servant of the count. Oh! There are spies from the Underworld !!!
254	The Knight's conviction is to protect love and justice!
255	Do not be fooled by the illusion in front of you!
256	What is happening? What fire is that?
257	Quick, bring some water! Come to extinguish the fire immediately!
258	Blasphemous demon, receive my punishment!
259	Villain! Feel the power of my Pegasus Meteor!
260	Over time, this blow ended with several subjects who insulted the Knights. See the blow! Comet of Pegasus!
261	Hunf! Do not be too proud, I'll finish you with the next blow!
262	Do not imagine that you would have that power, it seems that I will have to use another blow!
263	You ...... you really have that power ......
264	I'm feeling a little better ......
265	I am the essence of the Sea Dragon Cosmo, I will test the level of your Cosmo, you will have to completely avoid my next three attacks !!
266	Now test the power of the dragon's claw: Claw of the Abyss!
267	You have deviated very well ...... true, now see the strength of the vortex. Receive my Vortex roar!
268	Very well ...... the last blow is an attack through time. See my Dimension of Death!
269	​​Very well, you are really worthy to be the heir of the sacred scale of the Sea Dragon ... I can finally rest.
270	How to return to the orphanage? I have not finished playing yet ......
271	This is the Children of the Stars Orphanage, thank you for bringing me home.
272	Shunrei and Shiryu are here too, I've heard them say they're coming to join the Galactic Tournament!
273	It really exposed my disguise ......

2177	Xiao Lu and I ... we grow together. I wanted to become a Knight, I hoped to become a disciple of the old master of the Five Ancient Summits.
2178	However, the old teacher thinks that I do not understand the true meaning of force, and he did not accept me as a disciple ... that's why I traveled to practice, but in the forest Aokigahara I was trapped in an endless nightmare by a demon of sleep without can leave.
2179	I thought that I had been locked up for fifty years, who would say that there were only five ... By the nightmare, I became pale, my hair was all white. When I returned to the village, nobody recognized me.
2180	When I left, I tagged with Xiao Lu ... to meet us in three years. But five years have passed, I do not know if you still wait for me or not. But I want to see her again anyway ...
2181	Ah ... my head ... it hurts a lot ...
2182	...
2183	Oh, my head ... it hurts a lot ...
2184	Now you must be remembering everything. I looked for you for so long. You passed through the paths of the sea until you arrived in Rozan, and you still became an apprentice to Knight. Are you going to betray Poseidon?
2185	I still have a task that Poseidon has appointed me. Tomorrow I'll be here waiting for you.
2186	You came ...
2187	When I was still a child, I was saved from a shipwreck by Thetis. She raised me and I always tried to become a Marine, but an accident caused me to roam the roads of the sea to Rozan. I lost my memory, Peony and his father saved me and I became a disciple of the Master.
2188	Life in Rozan is very good, this is the best moment of my life, but ... I'm sorry, there are more important things than everything in that world, including life itself and love.
2189	I must return to Thetis and Poseidon ... Please say goodbye to Peony and your father for me. Goodbye my friend.
2190	Come on.
2191	Vipers!
2192	Sorry, Thetis ... I can not go back to Poseidon with you.
2193	Thetis ... You saved me from the shipwreck and you created me, you taught me to be a great Marines to fight for Poseidon.
2194	But, would doing that be correct? That time in Rozan, I learned a lot. Here people have very kind hearts, so I want to protect them. If Poseidon's plan is successful, everyone will die ... Forgive me, Thetis, I can not go back with you. I'll stay in Rozan and protect those I love.
2195	Thetis ...
2196	...
2197	I did not see anyone in Rozan, but I can not forgive who betrayed Poseidon. If he appears in front of me again, I will kill him personally.
2198	Until next time!
2199	Er ----
2200	Oh, I'm so happy!
2201	Am I pretty? I'm very worried!
2202	God, my heart is accelerated!
2203	Auauu!

2248	I do not remember how old I am anymore, remembering your age is a happy thing.
2249	Nacer del Sol .... sunset ..... born from the sun ..... sunset
2250	My current situation was totally generated in ignorance, one thing recurs: Eternal life does not mean that you will not grow old, it is necessary to remember it!
2251	Can you believe? I have already been a beauty, but now ......
2252	When a person went through many experiences, more than you can imagine, those ideas of good and evil, beauty and ugliness lose any meaning.
2253	In the aesthetics of that era, you are very well.
2254	When I was young I had a lover, he loved me very much, to the point of stupidity, well, now I can not die for the blessing he gave me, however at that moment I was very happy!
2255	Are you watching? That restriction in front? Oh, I want to go with you! Maybe only with the curse can I see that.
2256	I'm going to tell Julian his good intentions-
2257	Accepting bribes is an insult to us
