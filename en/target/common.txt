In addition to fighting like a ferocious bull, he still has his famous deadly blow, the Big Horn - whose posture, normally, is to put both hands on his chest and quickly release both arms, forming electro-shock waves and doubling his power. This technique of struggle is also similar to the sword of "Iaido". \rThe personality of Aldebaran is that of an uninhibited, honest and big-hearted person, who is not limited to outward appearance and great principles, relying only on his own determination. While the battle of the Twelve Houses, he intentionally facilitated for Seiya and the others to pass safely, resulting in one of his horns cut off.

When Seiya and the others come, Orpheus helps them, but ends up not participating in the Holy War immediately. In the end, because of Seiya and Shun, Orpheus discovers that the trap that Pharaoh had planned is the one that transformed Euridice into stone. That has made Orpheus understand the reason of life and face Pharaoh. At the moment when Orpheus leads Seiya and Shun to kill Hades, he is surprised by Radamanthys attack, being seriously wounded. Later, the biggest blow Orpheus makes is, in reality, an illusion of Hades, causing his movement to fail. Orpheus dies in battle at the Temple of Hades.

Regrettably, Cassios's destiny was only to be a supporting character, and, therefore, the author let him lose to Seiya during the Pegasus Armor competition, as well as having lost an ear too. \rIt is a person of respect for his grandiosity of sacrificing himself for love. When the Bronze Horsemen were in the race of the Twelve Houses, Seiya found a bitter struggle in the House of Leo: the Golden Knight of Leo, Aiolia, is attacked surreptitiously by the Grand Master, and under the Imperial Satan, with his sense of confused justice, attacks Seiya. The only way to get rid of the Imperial Satan would be to see the enemy die before him. Upon hearing that, Shina promptly ran to Leo's House - but, lest Shina be injured, Cassios died in her place, also saving Seiya, her former enemy.

Outraged by Seiya winning the Pegasus Armor in the place of his disciple, she attacked him while he tried to leave the Sanctuary. However, during the fight, he had his mask broken by Seiya, and for an Amazon, letting his face be seen by a man is the greatest of shame; according to the rules, you have to kill him or love him. For that reason, he went back to Seiya and tried to kill him several times, but, he joins the Bronze Knights when he learns that the Goddess Athena was next to them and, little by little, he ends up falling in love with the Pegasus Knight, reaching up to sacrifice for him in some battles.

He is the strongest Bronze Knight, as well as being good at attacks that manipulate the opponent's mind. A person overflowing hatred, calls himself "the man who gave up everything", but is described by Saga as that style of man "whose sense of justice is hidden inside his heart".

1811	^00BFFFHyoga
1812	Cygnus Bronze Knight and disciple of Camus of Aquarius. He has a discreet personality, always in conflict with his own emotions, despite trying to be rational above all.

So, he took his Golden Armor and the little Goddess and entrusted them to a tourist who was traveling through Greece, Mitsumasa Kido, and he died soon afterwards. Even after his death, his heroic spirit remained in the Golden Armor, and several times when Seiya and the others were in great danger, he appeared at his side, helping them overcome powerful enemies.

Defeated by the Excalibur of Shiryu, Krishna demonstrated an honest spirit like that of a samurai, respecting the adversary he considers worthy, even being an enemy.
1819	^9400D3Kanon
1820	Twin brother of Saga, although no one in the Sanctuary knew of its existence. He has a much more evil personality than his brother, this being the reason for having been imprisoned in the Cape Sunion. There, he ended up awakening the soul of Poseidon and passed by General Navy of Sea Dragon, wishing to use the name of the God of the Oceans to defeat Athena, with the purpose of conquering the whole Earth; this is the reason for his title of "The man who dared to deceive even the gods". After the War of the Underwater World, Kanon sincerely repented of his deeds and inherited the aspiration left by his brother, becoming the new Golden Knight of Gemini, fighting for the Goddess. His strength, in fact, is not inferior to that of Saga, so much so, that he fought at the same time and from the same to the same with the Three Judges of the Underworld.
1821	^9400D3 Aquarius Camus
1822	Golden Knight who protects the House of Aquarius. It is cold, prudent and determined. It has the title of "The Wizard of Ice". His behavior is controlled, honest and possesses genuine courage.

1823	^9400D3Milo
1824	Protector of the eighth of the Twelve Houses of the Sanctuary, the Scorpio Knight has the calmest personality among the Golden Knights. It is known in the Sanctuary as "The Sunbeam of Greece". He is very sure of himself and has a proud and passionate nature, but he is always very calm and controlled in battle. In the end, Milo and the other Golden Knights used their lives so that the Bronze Horsemen could open the way to the Champs-Elysees. Milo's loyalty to the Goddess and the love she had for the Earth were transformed into a bright ray of light, which will remain eternally in the Scorpio Armor.
1825	^9400D3Aphrodite
1826	Golden Knight of Pisces, it is said that there is no one more beautiful among the 88 Knights, having the title of "Warrior whose brightness of beauty competes with the Sun and the Moon". He has a great sense of justice, but he believes piously in the law of the strongest and that only a supreme power can maintain peace in the world. His blows transform the roses into weapons: among which is the red rose, which causes the opponent to lose his five senses; the black one, capable of breaking down any obstacle; and white, which absorbs the blood of his adversary. His Royal Diabolical Roses are among the greatest deadly attacks of all types of Knights.
1827	^00BFFFKiki

In the fight to protect the Pillar of the South Atlantic Ocean, he is defeated by Shun.
1833	^9400D3Rhadamanthys
1834	Celestial Star of Fury, the Wyvern Specter is known as "the strongest of the Three Judges of the Underworld" among the 108 Specters. When the story begins, contradicting Pandora's orders, he sends by himself a troop of Specters to advance against the Underworld; After that, he becomes a formidable opponent of Seiya and the others. He does not have only the trust of Hades, as he is also loved and respected by his subordinates. In the fight against Kanon, in the Underworld, he was hit by his opponent's suicide attack and ends up disappearing into the Underworld sky.
1835	^9400D3Mines
